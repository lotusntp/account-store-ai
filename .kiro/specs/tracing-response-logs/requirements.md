# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical issue where HTTP response logs are missing traceId and spanId information due to OpenTelemetry's MDC cleanup process. The current logging filter captures tracing information during request processing, but loses it when logging responses because OpenTelemetry clears the MDC context after the request chain completes.

The goal is to redesign the logging filter architecture to preserve tracing context throughout the entire request-response lifecycle, ensuring consistent tracing information in both request and response logs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring application logs, I want both request and response logs to contain the same traceId and spanId, so that I can correlate all log entries for a single request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a HTTP request is processed THEN the request log SHALL contain traceId and spanId from OpenTelemetry
2. WHEN the corresponding HTTP response is logged THEN the response log SHALL contain the same traceId and spanId as the request
3. WHEN OpenTelemetry clears MDC context THEN the logging filter SHALL still preserve tracing information for response logging
4. WHEN multiple requests are processed concurrently THEN each request-response pair SHALL maintain its own unique tracing context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator analyzing distributed traces, I want consistent tracing information across all log entries, so that I can track requests through the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request enters the logging filter THEN tracing context SHALL be captured and preserved
2. WHEN business logic executes THEN it SHALL use OpenTelemetry's tracing context normally
3. WHEN response logging occurs THEN the preserved tracing context SHALL be restored to MDC
4. WHEN the filter completes THEN MDC SHALL be properly cleaned up to prevent context leakage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance monitoring engineer, I want to trace request processing time with consistent identifiers, so that I can analyze end-to-end request performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN request processing begins THEN start time and tracing context SHALL be captured
2. WHEN request processing completes THEN duration SHALL be calculated with preserved tracing context
3. WHEN response is logged THEN it SHALL include duration, status code, and original tracing identifiers
4. WHEN structured logging is used THEN tracing fields SHALL be consistently formatted across all log entries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want reliable tracing context preservation, so that I can trust the correlation between request and response logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenTelemetry context is available THEN it SHALL take precedence over any fallback mechanisms
2. WHEN OpenTelemetry context is unavailable THEN the system SHALL generate consistent correlation identifiers
3. WHEN context preservation fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings without breaking functionality
4. WHEN concurrent requests are processed THEN context isolation SHALL be maintained between different threads

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the logging solution to be compatible with existing OpenTelemetry infrastructure, so that distributed tracing works seamlessly across services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenTelemetry is configured THEN the logging filter SHALL integrate without interfering with normal tracing operations
2. WHEN tracing context propagates between services THEN the logging filter SHALL preserve incoming trace headers
3. WHEN the application scales THEN the logging solution SHALL maintain performance without significant overhead
4. WHEN OpenTelemetry configuration changes THEN the logging filter SHALL adapt automatically without code changes
